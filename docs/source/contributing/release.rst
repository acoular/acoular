Release Policy
--------------

From Acoular version 24.05 onwards, we plan a new release every three months. An upcoming release has a corresponding `Milestone <https://github.com/acoular/acoular/milestones?state=open>`_ to which the Acoular Development Team assigns issues and pull requests that are planned to be included. The Milestone is created at the beginning of the development cycle and is closed when the release is published. A pull request must be fully merged into the master branch before the Milestone is closed to be included in the upcoming release. Note that source code can only be merged if it meets the :ref:`Code Quality Standards`.
