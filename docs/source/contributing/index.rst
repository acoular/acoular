Contributing 
============

Thank you for considering contributing to Acoular! We are always happy to welcome new contributors.
There are many ways to contribute to Acoular, and we appreciate all of them. 
Here are a few ideas of what you can do:

- **Report Issues**: If you find a bug in the source code or the documentation, you can submit an issue to the `issue tracker <https://github.com/acoular/acoular/issues>`_ on GitHub. However, the Acoular Development Team will decide on the priority of the problem and when it will be fixed. Thus, we cannot guarantee that the issue you reported will be solved in the next release. Instead, we encourage you to submit a pull request with a fix to speed up the process. Please read about the `Release Policy`_ and the `Contribution Guidelines`_ before submitting a pull request.
- **Taking Part in Discussions**: You can join the `Acoular discussions forum <https://github.com/acoular/acoular/discussions>`_ to ask questions, discuss existing and new features. If you have a concrete feature request that might be also interesting for the community, you can also submit it `here <https://github.com/acoular/acoular/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2Cnew+feature&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=FEATURE+REQUEST%3A+%3CFill+in+a+descriptive+title+for+the+feature+request%3E>`_.
- **Contribute Code**: You can contribute code to Acoular by forking the repository and submitting a pull request. It doesn't need to be a big feature; it can be as simple as fixing a typo in the documentation. Please make sure to first read the `Contribution Guidelines`_ before submitting a pull request.


.. _Release Policy:

Release Policy
--------------

From Acoular version 24.05 onwards, we plan a new release every four months. An upcoming release has a corresponding `Milestone <https://github.com/acoular/acoular/milestones?state=open>`_ to which the Acoular Development Team assigns issues and pull requests that are planned to be included. The Milestone is created at the beginning of the development cycle and is closed when the release is published. A pull request must be fully merged into the master branch before the Milestone is closed to be included in the upcoming release. Note that source code can only be merged if it meets the :ref:`Code Quality Standards`.
