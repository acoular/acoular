Plot Style
----------

For consistent plot appearance, use the Acoular matplotlib style in your
scripts or notebooks:

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Apply Acoular plot style
   plt.style.use('acoular.plots')
   
   # Now create your plots
   # ...

This style is automatically applied when building the documentation with
Sphinx Gallery and in Jupyter notebooks generated from the examples.
