class RotatingFlow(FlowField):
    """
    Analytical approximation of a rotating flow field with additional velocity component
    in z-direction.

    This class provides an analytical model for a fluid flow field with a
    rigid-body-like rotation about the z-axis. The flow combines rotational motion
    in the x-y plane and a constant velocity component in the z-direction.

    Notes
    -----
    - The rotation is assumed to be about the z-axis. The velocity components in the x-y plane are
      determined by the angular velocity :attr:`omega`, while the z-component is constant
      and set by :attr:`v0`.
    - The angular velocity :attr:`omega` is computed as: ``omega = 2 * pi * rps``,
      with the :attr:`rps` given in revolutions per second (i.e. Hz).

def spiral_sphere(N, Om=None, b=None):  # noqa: N803 # change to 4*pi
    """
    Generate unit vectors equally distributed over a sphere or a portion of it.

    Internal helper function for the raycasting that returns an array of unit
    vectors of shape `(N, 3)` giving equally distributed directions on a part
    of sphere given by the center direction ``b`` and the solid angle ``Om``.

    The function uses spherical coordinates to distribute the points, the converts them to Cartesian
    coordinates. It also applies a transformation to reflect the points about a plane so that the
    direction defined by the vector ``b`` points toward the center of the sphere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : :class:`int`
        The number of points to generate on the sphere.

    Om : :class:`float`, optional
        The solid angle in steradians to cover on the sphere. Default is ``2 * pi``,
        which corresponds to a hemisphere. Smaller values result in covering
        a smaller portion of the hemisphere.

    b : :class:`numpy.ndarray` of :class:`floats<float>`, optional
        A 3D unit vector specifying the desired center direction of the distribution.
        Points are mirrored such that this vector points toward the center of the sphere.
        Default is ``[0, 0, 1]``, which corresponds to the z-axis.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`numpy.ndarray` of :class:`floats<float>`
        An array of unit vectors representing points on the sphere, shape `(3, N)`.
        Each column corresponds to a 3D Cartesian coordinate of a point.

    Notes
    -----
    - The points are initially distributed using a spiral pattern in spherical coordinates.
      This ensures an approximately equal spacing between points over the specified portion
      of the sphere.
    - If a vector ``b`` is provided, the function mirrors the distribution using a
      Householder reflection so that ``b`` points toward the center.
    - The function avoids generating singularities at the poles by adjusting the spiral
      distribution formula.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate 100 points over a hemisphere:

    >>> from acoular.environments import spiral_sphere
    >>> points = spiral_sphere(100)
    >>> points.shape
    (3, 100)

    Generate 50 points over half a hemisphere with the z-axis as the center direction:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> points = spiral_sphere(50, Om=np.pi, b=array((0, 0, 1)))
    >>> points.shape
    (3, 50)

    Generate 200 points with a different direction vector:
